## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### 🔧 Backend (FastAPI + MySQL)

1. **Setup Python environment**

```bash
cd campusquest-backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Create a `.env` file**

```
DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://<user>:<password>@localhost/<database>
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
```

3. **Start the server**

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

---

### 💻 Frontend (React)

```bash
cd campusquest-frontend
npm install
npm start
```

This will launch the React app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Ensure your backend runs at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## 🔐 Auth Flow

- Users can **Register / Login**
- JWT token is stored in browser local storage
- Protected pages check token validity
- Currently, user role changes (e.g., making someone admin) must be done via the database manually

---

## 📈 Core Logic

- Aptitude test auto-submits after time ends or all questions are answered
- College recommendations are filtered based on:
  - Aptitude Score
  - 12th % Score
  - Preferred stream and course
- Application status is tracked locally for the user
- Admin can view scores and applications (read-only)

---

## 🧠 Sample Test User

```
Username: testuser
Password: testpass
Role: user
```

*Role changes to "admin" must be applied manually via the DB for now.*

---

## 🚧 Planned Improvements

- 🏆 Leaderboard for top scorers
- 📄 PDF download of result + college list
- ✉️ Application status reminders via email
- 📊 Admin filters and search in application logs
